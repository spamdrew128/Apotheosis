# About
As my first real experience with engine development, this project is more of a learning experience for me than anything else. My goal in creating this engine is to hit 2500 ELO CCRL.

# How to build:
Windows/Linux (you must have some version of GCC installed):

`make` will build both the debug and the main binary

`make clean` will clean all object files

The release can be built by `sh release.sh`

MacOS:

Bro I have no idea, you're on your own

# UCI
This is not a complete chess program, you need a UCI compatible program to run it.

Cute Chess is one that I typically use, you can find it here: https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess
